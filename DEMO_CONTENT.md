## Single-Sentence Responses (Quick Testing)

Use these for rapid workflow testing:

**Epoch 1 Turns:**
1. The framework prioritizes patient safety through continuous monitoring of AI system performance and rapid response to detected anomalies.
2. Healthcare institutions must establish governance committees that include clinical, technical, ethical, and patient representation.
3. Regular ethics reviews should assess both algorithmic fairness and real-world deployment outcomes.
4. Training programs should equip healthcare workers to recognize AI limitations and maintain critical thinking.
5. Patient feedback mechanisms must enable reporting of concerns about AI-influenced care decisions.
6. The framework must evolve continuously through stakeholder input and evidence from deployment experiences.

**Epoch 2 Turns:**
(Same as Epoch 1 - reuse for speed)
