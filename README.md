> This is a prototype under active development. While functional, this extension requires further testing and refinement before public release. Features may change and bugs may be present.

# 🌍 AI-Empowered Participatory Governance

**A browser extension that enables validated policy insights using the GyroDiagnostics framework for any AI chat interface.**

## What This Extension Does

Transform everyday AI conversations into rigorous governance analysis. This browser extension applies mathematical validation to AI-generated solutions for UN Sustainable Development Goals and community challenges.

**You provide**: A governance challenge  
**AI provides**: Structured reasoning through synthesis  
**We provide**: Mathematical quality assessment  
**Community receives**: Public knowledge repository

## 🎯 The Access Problem

The Future of Life Institute's [2025 AI Safety Index](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-summer-2025/) documents how meaningful AI evaluation remains gated behind employee-level permissions. Communities tackling real issues, from energy transitions to healthcare equity, need reliable validation tools.

Our response: leverage whatever AI services you already access through a clipboard-based workflow compatible with ChatGPT, Claude, LMArena, Poe, or any chat interface.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 🔬 Mathematical Validation
GyroDiagnostics evaluation across Structure, Behavior, and Specialization dimensions, producing three key indices:
- **Quality Index**: Weighted performance metric
- **Alignment Rate (AR)**: Temporal efficiency measure  
- **Superintelligence Index (SI)**: Structural coherence via K₄ topology

### 🌐 Platform Agnostic
No API keys required. The extension guides you through:
- Clipboard-based prompt management
- Response capture via element picker
- Platform-specific navigation tips

### 📊 Three-Step Protocol
1. **Participation**: Frame your challenge
2. **Preparation**: Orchestrate synthesis and analysis phases
3. **Provision**: Generate validated reports

### 🤝 Knowledge Commons
Export findings as JSON, Markdown, or contribute directly to GitHub under CC0 license.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gyrogovernance/apps.git
cd apps
npm install
npm run build
```

**Chrome Setup**:
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Toggle "Developer mode"
3. Select "Load unpacked" → choose `dist/` folder

**First Use**:
1. Click extension icon for side panel
2. Select or define a challenge template
3. Follow guided workflow
4. Export your validated analysis

## 📈 Distinctive Approach

| Conventional AI Tools | This Framework |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Requires enterprise access | Uses existing chat interfaces |
| Focuses on capabilities | Addresses governance needs |
| Proprietary methods | Open-source validation |
| Binary safety checks | Nuanced quality spectrum |

## 🎓 Technical Foundation

### Participation → Preparation → Provision

The extension orchestrates a structured dialogue where AI explores your challenge through six reasoning cycles across two epochs. Independent AI evaluators then assess the output using 20 distinct metrics.

### Tensegrity Geometry

Behavioral metrics map to edges of a tetrahedral graph, decomposing into:
- Gradient components (global coherence)
- Residual components (local variation)
- Aperture measurement against theoretical optimum (A* ≈ 0.02070)

This eliminates hierarchical bias through pure geometric assessment.
