## üéØ The Challenge

Communities and organizations require validation for AI-generated policy recommendations across domains like climate action, healthcare equity, and resource allocation. Current barriers include restricted access to advanced AI systems, general capability testing that doesn't address governance-specific quality, and high expertise requirements for rigorous evaluation. AI Inspector addresses this by providing platform-agnostic mathematical assessment through a clipboard-based workflow, making sophisticated AI evaluation accessible to any community with access to AI chat interfaces.

---

## What You Get

**You provide**: A governance challenge  
**AI provides**: Structured reasoning through synthesis  
**AI Inspector provides**: Content quality assessment and AI model behavior inspection  
**You receive**: Validated insights stored locally for your analysis

## üìö Key Concepts

<details>
<summary><strong>GyroDiagnostics Framework</strong></summary>

Mathematical framework for AI alignment measurement through rubric-based scoring across 12 metrics in three levels (Structure, Behavior, Specialization), followed by geometric decomposition yielding Quality Index (QI: 0-100% aggregate performance), Alignment Rate (AR: quality points per minute), and Superintelligence Index (SI: behavioral balance, theoretical optimum = 100).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Superintelligence Index (SI)</strong></summary>

Measures behavioral balance as the optimum measure of alignment. Derived from aperture ratio against target A* ‚âà 0.02070 via Hodge decomposition on K‚ÇÑ graph topology. Higher SI correlates with balanced reasoning and lower pathology rates.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Behavioral Balance</strong></summary>

Equilibrium among measurable reasoning qualities (coherence, accuracy, adaptability). Assessed via K‚ÇÑ tetrahedral topology and Hodge decomposition, separating gradient components (coherence) from cycle components (differentiation).

</details>

## ‚ú® Core Capabilities

**Theoretical Grounding**: Powered by GyroDiagnostics, which measures how geometric necessities from the Common Governance Model (CGM) manifest as behavioral qualities in AI reasoning. We capture these through rubric-based assessment, then derive quantitative metrics via geometric decomposition.

### üî¨ Mathematical Inspection
Inspects AI responses across 12 metrics in three dimensions:
- **Reasoning Coherence**: Foundational behaviors like traceability and integrity
- **Behavior**: Accuracy and reliability patterns
- **Specialization**: Domain-specific expertise

### üìä Three Key Indices
- **Quality Index**: Weighted performance score (0-100%)
- **Alignment Rate**: Quality per minute (detects rushed vs. thorough reasoning)
- **Superintelligence Index**: Geometric balance measure (theoretical optimum = 100)

### üåê Works Everywhere
Compatible with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LMArena, Poe, or any chat interface - no special access required.

### üíæ Local-First Storage
All insights are stored locally in your browser extension. Export findings as needed for your own analysis and research.

### üî¨ Rapid Test
**NEW**: Rapid multi-dimensional quality assessment via JSON workflow. Provide an evaluation prompt to your AI and receive structured JSON scoring to compute behavioral quality metrics (QI, AR, SI) through rubric-based assessment across 12 evaluation criteria.

**Key Features:**
- **Behavioral Balance Gauge**: Visual indicator showing Superintelligence Index (SI) and behavioral balance status
- **Multi-criteria Evaluation**: Rubric-based assessment across 12 quality dimensions
- **Behavioral Quality Assessment**: Measures behavioral qualities through multi-dimensional assessment rubrics
- **Pathology Detection**: Identifies specific behavioral failure modes through pattern analysis
- **Single Analyst Evaluation**: One AI model provides structured JSON evaluation response
- **Export Options**: Save results as insights or export Markdown/JSON reports

**Perfect for**: Verifying AI responses, assessing behavioral quality, quality assurance for AI-generated content.

**How It Works:**
1. **Provide Prompt**: Copy the evaluation prompt to your AI interface (references your conversation/topic)
2. **Receive JSON**: AI returns structured JSON with scoring data following the rubric
3. **Automated Processing**: System calculates Quality Index (QI), Alignment Rate (AR), and Superintelligence Index (SI) from the JSON evaluation
4. **Visual Results**: Behavioral Balance Gauge shows SI and balance status at a glance
5. **Detailed Report**: Full scoring analysis and technical details

**Note**: JSON-only workflow; no transcript storage or handling. Single analyst evaluation pattern.

## üìñ Documentation

- **[General Specifications](docs/GyroGovernance_Apps_General_Specs.md)** - Comprehensive overview of architecture, features, and user journey
- **[GyroDiagnostics Specs](docs/GyroDiagnostics_General_Specs.md)** - Core evaluation methodology and metrics
- **[Import/Export Guide](docs/IMPORT_EXPORT.md)** - Data management and migration
 - **[Development Testing Guide](DEV_Server.md)** - Dev server, builds, and unified assets layout

### Scripts

- `npm run dev-server`: Hot reload dev server at `http://localhost:3000/sidepanel.html`
- `npm run build`: Production build to `dist/`
- `npm run serve-static`: Build then serve static `dist/` files

### Assets Layout (Dev and Prod)

- Source of truth: `assets/`
  - `assets/icons/*`
  - `assets/media/*`
  - `assets/fonts/*`
  - `assets/files/results.zip`

- Dev server serves assets at `/assets/...`
- Production build copies the same structure to `dist/assets/...`

## üéØ Why This Matters

The [2025 AI Safety Index](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-summer-2025/) shows meaningful AI evaluation remains restricted to corporate insiders. Communities tackling real challenges need accessible inspection tools.

Our solution: Use whatever AI you can access, add mathematical rigor to inspect the outputs.

## üìà What Makes This Different

| Conventional AI Tools | AI Inspector Framework |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Requires enterprise access | Uses your existing chat access |
| Tests capabilities | Inspects governance alignment |
| Proprietary black box | Open-source transparency |
| Binary pass/fail | Nuanced quality spectrum |
| Expert-only | Citizen-accessible |

---

## üéì How It Works

### Three-Phase Protocol
1. **Participation**: Frame your governance challenge
2. **Preparation**: AI generates 6 turns across 2 epochs
3. **Provision**: Mathematical inspection produces validated report

### Tensegrity Geometry
The framework uses tetrahedral (K‚ÇÑ) topology to eliminate bias:
- Maps reasoning to geometric structure
- Decomposes into coherence vs. adaptation components
- Measures against theoretical optimum (A* ‚âà 0.02070)
