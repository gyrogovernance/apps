## What You Get

**You provide**: A governance challenge  
**AI provides**: Structured reasoning through synthesis  
**We provide**: Mathematical quality assessment  
**Community receives**: Public knowledge repository

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 seconds)

1. **Download**: Get `gyrogovernance-extension-v0.2.1.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/gyrogovernance/apps/releases)
2. **Extract**: Unzip to any folder
3. **Install**: Open `chrome://extensions/` → Enable "Developer mode" → "Load unpacked" → Select folder
4. **Launch**: Click extension icon in toolbar ✅

---

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Open the extension** side panel by clicking the icon
2. **Select a challenge** (or create your own):
   - Energy transition policy
   - Healthcare equity
   - Climate adaptation
   - Any SDG-aligned topic
3. **Copy prompts** to your AI chat (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
4. **Capture responses** using the element picker
5. **Get validated analysis** with three key metrics:
   - Quality Index (overall performance)
   - Alignment Rate (reasoning efficiency)
   - Superintelligence Index (structural coherence)
6. **Export results** as JSON/Markdown or share to Knowledge Commons

**No API keys needed** - works with any AI chat interface through clipboard.

---

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 🔬 Mathematical Validation
Evaluates AI responses across 20 metrics in three dimensions:
- **Structure**: Reasoning coherence and integrity
- **Behavior**: Accuracy and reliability patterns
- **Specialization**: Domain-specific expertise

### 📊 Three Key Indices
- **Quality Index**: Weighted performance score (0-100%)
- **Alignment Rate**: Quality per minute (detects rushed vs. thorough reasoning)
- **Superintelligence Index**: Geometric balance measure (theoretical optimum = 100)

### 🌐 Works Everywhere
Compatible with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LMArena, Poe, or any chat interface - no special access required.

### 🤝 Knowledge Commons
Export validated findings to contribute to open governance research under CC0 license.

---

## 📚 Who This Helps

**Communities**: Evidence-based policy development  
**Researchers**: Reproducible governance experiments  
**Policy Makers**: Quality assessment of AI recommendations  
**NGOs**: Validated advocacy proposals  
**Citizens**: Direct participation in AI governance

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

The [2025 AI Safety Index](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-summer-2025/) shows meaningful AI evaluation remains restricted to corporate insiders. Communities tackling real challenges need accessible validation tools.

Our solution: Use whatever AI you can access, add mathematical rigor to validate the outputs.

## 📈 What Makes This Different

| Conventional AI Tools | GyroGovernance Framework |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Requires enterprise access | Uses your existing chat access |
| Tests capabilities | Validates governance alignment |
| Proprietary black box | Open-source transparency |
| Binary pass/fail | Nuanced quality spectrum |
| Expert-only | Citizen-accessible |

---

## 🎓 How It Works

### Three-Phase Protocol
1. **Participation**: Frame your governance challenge
2. **Preparation**: AI generates 6 turns across 2 epochs
3. **Provision**: Mathematical analysis produces validated report

### Tensegrity Geometry
The framework uses tetrahedral (K₄) topology to eliminate bias:
- Maps reasoning to geometric structure
- Decomposes into coherence vs. adaptation components
- Measures against theoretical optimum (A* ≈ 0.02070)

This isn't subjective judgment - it's mathematical measurement of reasoning structure.
