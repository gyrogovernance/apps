AI INSPECTOR: Chrome Extension Mitigating Jailbreaks, Deceptive Alignment, and X-Risk

Browser extension Mitigating Jailbreaks, Deceptive Alignment, and X-Risk through quality assessment of AI outputs and safety documentation. Works with any AI chat (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) using clipboard-based workflow. No-code tool, no API keys are necessary, and none of your data are sent to servers.

🔍 TWO WAYS TO USE

FULL GYRODIAGNOSTICS EVALUATION (30-40 min)
Deep analysis producing three mathematical indices:
• Quality Index (QI): 0-100% score showing if output meets professional standards
• Superintelligence Index (SI): Measures reasoning depth vs. surface-level responses
• Alignment Rate (AR): Output quality per minute - identifies rushed or superficial work
Plus 20+ detailed metrics across Structure, Behavior, and Specialization.

QUICK GADGETS (3-10 min each)
Six specialized tools for rapid assessment:
• Rapid Test: Get QI/SI/AR metrics for any AI output
• Policy Auditing: Extract claims & evidence from documents
• Policy Reporting: Generate executive synthesis with attribution
• AI Infection Sanitization: Remove hidden Unicode/whitespace patterns
• Pathologies Immunity Boost: Enhance content across 12 quality metrics
• Meta-Evaluation: AI safety documentation analysis (see below)

🛡️ AI SAFETY: META-EVALUATION GADGET

Evaluates AI safety documentation (model cards, eval reports, safety assessments) using The Human Mark framework - a formal system mapping all AI safety failures to four root causes:

• GTD - Governance Traceability Displacement
• IVD - Information Variety Displacement
• IAD - Inference Accountability Displacement
• IID - Intelligence Integrity Displacement

3-task pipeline: Detect displacement risks → Map governance structures → Get surgical improvement recommendations

Essential for AI safety labs and frontier model developers.

🎯 WHO USES IT

AI SAFETY: Labs evaluating documentation, frontier developers detecting alignment failures

POLICY & GOVERNANCE: Researchers, NGOs, communities developing evidence-based AI policy

GENERAL USERS: Anyone assessing AI outputs for professional or critical work

🌐 HOW IT WORKS

CLIPBOARD-BASED WORKFLOW = PRIVACY + FLEXIBILITY

1. Copy prompts from extension
2. Paste into your AI chat
3. Copy AI responses
4. Paste back into extension
5. Get metrics & export results

WHY CLIPBOARD?
• Works with any AI platform (even ones without APIs)
• Your data never leaves your browser
• No subscription, no rate limits
• Use free AI tiers or local models

All evaluations stored locally. Export as JSON/Markdown anytime.
